 - Fixes #25



TODO :
Inkana's ideas
- fix the leader negociation menus so a faction can't negociate with itself (make it so elves cannot negociate with elves)
- add more images for the Drake Worker (attack, defense, etc.)
- fix the "donate fund" option for PVP. for now, you can give to ally or enemy without distinction. (may try and fix, but it seems to show the name)
